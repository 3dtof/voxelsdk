/**
 * \mainpage Voxel SDK API Documentation
 * 
 * Voxel Library is meant to be a platform to 
 * interface one or more depth cameras, with a common higher-level API.
 * The higher level API is explained here. For installation instructions and overall documentation 
 * of Voxel library, see https://github.com/3dtof/voxelsdk/wiki.
 *
 * \section Conventions Coding Conventions
 * All public API elements are enclosed in namespace \ref Voxel. 
 * \subsection Naming Naming Conventions
 * 1. All class names are in title case. E.g.: \ref Voxel::EnumParameter
 * 2. All function names and variable names are also in title case, 
 *    except that the first character is always in lower case. E.g.: \ref breakLines()
 * 3. All protected/private member begin with underscore, and public members do not. E.g.: \ref Voxel::DepthCamera::_addParameters()
 * 
 * \subsection CommonSTD Common Data-structures
 * Several common STL data-structures such std::vector, std::list, std::thread, etc. are used in Voxel library. 
 * However, they have been wrapped in typedefs and template aliases for ease of replacement later if necessary.
 * All replacement typedefs are defined in \ref Common.h, and follows naming discussed in Section \ref Naming.
 *
 * \section libvoxel libvoxel API Structure
 * Two primary API classes which will be used by most of the users, are \ref Voxel::CameraSystem and \ref Voxel::DepthCamera.
 *
 * \section libti3dtof API structure of TI's Depth Camera Support Library
 * \ref Voxel::TI::ToFCameraBase is the main abstract class which partially implements \ref Voxel::DepthCamera.
 * \ref Voxel::TI::ToFCameraBase is not TI specific, but makes an assumption about ToF type depth cameras. \ref Voxel::TI::ToFCamera is the main abstract class which 
 * is TI specific, and it is derived from \ref Voxel::TI::ToFCameraBase.
 * \ref Voxel::TI::ToFHaddockCamera is further derived from \ref Voxel::TI::ToFCamera and adds Haddock 
 * generation specific support including parameters. However, this does not have board-specific details.
 * \ref Voxel::TI::Voxel14Camera is an example of board-specific class for Voxel-14 board, inherited from
 * \ref Voxel::TI::ToFHaddockCamera. \ref Voxel::TI::Voxel14Camera defines board-specific versions of \ref Voxel::Streamer, \ref Voxel::Downloader and \ref Voxel::RegisterProgrammer.
 *
 * The rest of the classes in Voxel SDK are used to handle various individual functionalities. See <a href="modules.xhtml">Modules</a> to know about these classes.
